How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    Shows only the lines that were changed, so that i don't have to look over 
	the entire file.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    Helps understand why and when changes were made.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Allows commits after logical changes have been made in finished and also 
	code is still working.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Git is made for version control of code where often several files make 
	up one program.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log to see history and git diff with both file IDs to see changes made.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    Can always revert back to workinh version ti figure out what went wrong

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    Writing and saving code
